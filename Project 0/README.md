# Project 0
My project is titled Jogger, its a relatively simple game that was inspired by Frogger! The premise of the game is to guide the player character across the roadways and toward the star, while avoiding the dangerous vehicles. \
 \
To navigate the player character, simply use your keyboard's arrow keys. Once you reach the star, all you need to do is walk into it to trigger a cool surprise. \
 \
Good luck and have fun! :) \
